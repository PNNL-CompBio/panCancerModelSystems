# Pan-Cancer Model Systems
This project will explore the differences between model systems to identify systemic biases across tumors and models toward mapping from one to the other.

## Data
The data from this project will be collected and analyzed [in a separate repository](https://github.com/PNNL-CompBio/candleDataProcessing/) and stored on Figshare. Below are the datasets that we are in the process of collecting and formatting.

| Data | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Cell Line data](https://figshare.com/s/525f7777039f4610ef47) | This includes the CCLE cell line molecular data together with dose response data. |
| [CPTAC 4 data](https://figshare.com/s/7ffe48478ec907b36dfb) | This includes matched gene and protein expression data. |
| [HCMI data]() | This will contain the data from human cancer models |

## Models evaluated
We will systematically evaluate models and list them below. The primary benchmarks will be how well we can simulate data from one model type. toanother, and how well we can map across datasets. 

## Next steps
There are future goals for this project including:
- predicting stroma in AML
- adding in MPNST data
